# üó∫Ô∏èüìç in-class lab: countermapping

We are going to do some "no-code" mapping today, working solo and in groups.

1. **Join your group in a breakout session, ~3 people**
  - ‚è∞ assign a timekeeper, to keep track of tasks/time
  - üìù assign a notetaker, who will take notes [here](https://pad.riseup.net/p/ulXNRIbDnpNPGcpgOiyr-keep)

2. **Critical mapping ~45 min.**
  - First, think of a place that you know _very well_.
  - Find an online map (Google, etc.) of this place.
  - Look critically at this version of your place - what is missing, what is lacking, what may be wrong, what could you add to the map?
  - Think about various _knowledges_ that you bring to this map - in the realm of experience, memory
  - Get a free account on [felt.com](https://felt.com/)
  - Felt is a "no-code" or "low-code," drag-and-drop accessible mapping platform. Get familiar with it just to make a short project; you might want to check out just the start of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gLvhVlX82Y&list=PLulpFBGeM9D56pqKcZYKOb_r10ax0Vzhy&index=3)
  - Make a sketch, a simple expression of what you would add to a map of your place. You can (manually) add points, images, draw shapes, add text, etc. Be prepared to share this map.
  - **felt.com tip:**  üì∏ You can upload an image by dragging it and dropping it onto the map.
  - During this time you can work solo, but have your zoom open to the breakout session. You are always welcome to brainstorm or ask questions as a group.
  - The **timekeeper** will check in and call the small group back together after ~45 min.

3. **Group discussion ~15 min.**
  - The **notetaker** should take notes [here](https://pad.riseup.net/p/ulXNRIbDnpNPGcpgOiyr-keep)
  - Share your maps with your group, discuss the stories and process of making them, where you would develop them further
  - Discuss in relation to the readings - how, in particular, does this relate to the Borges short story?

 After ~1 hr, we will come back together as the whole class.
