# ðŸ“£ FINAL REFLECTIONS for VISUAL ANALYTICS!

ðŸ’¥ **due date change**: I will accept these until **Sat. Dec. 14th @ 11:59pm** NYC-time

Prompt: Given the readings from Week 14 on missing data as context, there are multiple paradigms through which we can think about "missing" data. We can think about holes in the dataset that we need to go find, through collection or scraping; we can take steps to find the holes in our dataset with tools like missingno in python. Or, there is data that is missing by design: due to existing power relations in the world, there is some data that may not be considered worthy of collection. Further, there is some information about the world that will always resist collection and quantification.

In about ~800 words, reflect on what is missing from your group's final visualization. (Something always is!) Consider what cannot be mapped. In your short reflection, consider also how you grew as a data practitioner from Project #1 to Project #2 in this class. Please also include a description of the division of labor of your group for the final project and how the process went.

this will be the final work in this class! please submit the short papers as attachments, via DM over Discord or to my e-mail.
